print(2+2)
#We can print the value we want to print on the screen with the print statement.
#We can switch to python mode by typing the python entry in the terminal.
#Here, we see what data type the value we entered is with the type() function.
#For example, we can understand that this value is integer with the type(2) input. Our output will be: <class 'int'>.
#type(2.0) --> <class 'float'>
